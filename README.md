## Getting Started ##

* __To build:__
 ```
  $ npm run build
 ```

* __To start the server:__
 ```
  $ npm run start
 ```

* __To start in dev mode, with everything watched:__
 ```
  $ npm run watch
 ```

### TODO: ###
 * Use makefiles to cut down on some of the work.

  *(e.g., `npm run start` currently runs `npm run build` unconditionally).*
