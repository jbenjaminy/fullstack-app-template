# Full-Stack App #

***Basic full-stack JavaScript app template.***

## Technologies ##
 * [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/) - A frontend JavaScript library.
 * [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) - A backend JavaScript runtime.

## Getting Started ##

* To build:
 ```
  $ npm run build
 ```

* To start the server:
 ```
  $ npm run start
 ```

* To start in dev mode, with everything watched:
 ```
  $ npm run watch
 ```

### TODO ###
* Use makefiles to cut down on some of the work
***(e.g., `npm run start` currently runs `npm run build` unconditionally).***
